        <p>Since its onset, the computer has allowed for precise and efficient calculations. Through its efficient nature, the computer also allowed for a reduction in time to create complex, repetitive compositions.<sup>1</sup> This ability, as stated in Form + Code, “was often the motivation for the early adoption of software and its integration into the creative process.”<sup>2</sup>  The time saved by the computers’ work allows for more freedom and time to explore.<sup>3</sup> As Michael Noll puts it, the computer becomes, “an intellectual and active creative partner that, when fully exploited, could be used to produce wholly new art forms and possibly new aesthetic experiences.”<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Following a degree in Studio Arts at Hamline University, Jenna went on to study Interactive Design at MCAD. It was during this time that Jenna was first introduced to p5.js, a client-side JavaScript library. P5.js helped facilitate an experimental interaction with the computer, allowing Jenna the freedom to move away from traditional subject matter and explore abstract shapes and concepts.</p>

<p>This body of work has given way to the development of the Drawing Tool. While building the Drawing Tool, there were a number of steps and significant breakthroughs along the way. Each work featured in the exhibition, <i>Discover a Space Between</i>, has a role in the development and creation of the Drawing Tool. The Discovery Log found below outlines the order sequence and the significance of each piece in the Drawing Tool creation.</p>

        <h2># Discovery Log</h2>
        <p>All notable changes to this project will be outlined here.</p>

        <p>## <b>[Axis] – 2020-16-09</b></br>
        ## Computational Drawing, Archival Inkjet on Cotton Rag Paper</br>
        ## 14” x 14”</br>
        ### </br>
        - Initial Drawing Tool Prototype sketch created. Axis is the home base for every browser refresh on the Drawing Tool.</p>

        <p>## <b>[Encounter] – 2020-09-10</b></br>
        ## Computational Drawing, Archival Inkjet on Cotton Rag Paper</br>
        ## 17” x 17”</br>
        ### </br>
        - In a search to add complexity to the drawing tool, experimentation led to the creation of Encounter. It was noted that Translate and Rotate were the key factors in adding complexity to the original sketch.</p>

        <p><b>## [Meridian] – 2020-10-10</b></br>
        ## Computational Drawing, Archival Inkjet on Cotton Rag Paper</br>
        ## 39” x 47”</br>
        ### </br>
        - Unhappy with the small size of Encounter, I set out to enlarge the work. Meridian was born out of this exploration.</p>

        <p>## <b>[Discovery 1.0] – 2020-13-10</b></br>
        ## Computational Drawing, Archival Inkjet on Cotton Rag Paper</br>
        ## 14” x 14”</br>
        ### </br>
        - After the explorations with Encounter and Meridian, it became clear that Rotate and Translate were important factors to add into the drawing tool. These controls were added to the Tool, and from this came Discover 1.0.

        <p>## <b>[Discovery 2.0] – 2020-13-10</b></br>
        ## Computational Drawing, Archival Inkjet on Cotton Rag Paper</br>
        ## 14” x 14”</br>
        ### </br>
        - Invert ability was added to the Drawing Tool. From this, Discovery 2.0 was born.</p>
